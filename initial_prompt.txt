Create a demo application that will publish a new work order to the MQTT Broker UNS every hour with the following requirements met:

1. The application will be using Python 3.12 with Paho MQTT library.
2. Create requirements.txt for all python libraries used in the project with proper versions.
3. We must use CESMII Smart Manufacturing (SM) Profile for the work order. 
	a. Refer to CESMII guidance for SM Profiles here: https://github.com/cesmii/ProveIt-SMProfiles
	b. We will host the SM Profile for work order version 1 "WorkOrderV1" in our github repo: "https://www.github.com/eukodyne/cesmii/smprofiles/WorkOrderV1.jsonld"
	c. The profile will be using CESMII JSON-LD rules.
	d. The profile will refer to another custom SM Profile that we will host in Github in the same folder called FeedIngredientV1.
	e. The FeedIngredientV1 SM Profile will have these fields based on OPC-UA:
		* ProductID: String
		* ProductNumber: Int64
		* ProductName: String		
		* LotNumber: String
		* UnitOfMeasure: String
		* Quantity: Double
		* WeightUnitOfMeasure: String
		* Weight: Double
	f. The work order (WorkOrderV1) will have the following fields:
		* WorkOrderID: String
		* WorkOrderNumber: Int32
		* TimeZone: TimeZoneDataType (https://profiledesigner.cesmii.net/type/125298)
		* StartTimeLocal: DateTime
		* StartTimeUTC: UtcTime
		* EndTimeLocal: DateTime
		* EndTimeUTC: UtcTime
		* ProductID: String
		* ProductNumber: Int64
		* ProductName: String		
		* LotNumber: String
		* UnitOfMeasure: String
		* Quantity: Double
		* WeightUnitOfMeasure: String
		* Weight: Double
		* FeedIngredients: a list of unlimited length of type FeedIngredientV1
	
4. Create and publish JSON-LD SM Profiles FeedIngredientV1 and WorkOrderV1 in json-ld format.
5. Create a file called config.json, which will have these properties:
	* mqtt-endpoint
		* host
		* port
		* username
		* password
	* mqtt-publish-topic (the topic where the work order is getting published)
6. Search the web to verify the CESMII guidance for SM Profiles to see whether the actual work order JSON payload needs to carry the namespace pointer / pointer to the profile definition in it. If so, add it to the work order payload.
7. In the Python app, create a lookup list of demo products (DemoProducts):
	* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 2221, ProductName = "Product A"
		* Feed Ingredients:
			* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 2001, ProductName = "Product A1", MixProportion = 10%
			* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 2002, ProductName = "Product A2", MixProportion = 30%
			* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 2003, ProductName = "Product A3", MixProportion = 60%
	* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 4450, ProductName = "Product B"
		* Feed Ingredients:
			* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 4001, ProductName = "Product B1", MixProportion = 30%
			* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 4002, ProductName = "Product B2", MixProportion = 70%			
	* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 3170, ProductName = "Product C"
		* Feed Ingredients:
			* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 3001, ProductName = "Product C1", MixProportion = 50%
			* ProductID = New GUID, ProductNumber = 3002, ProductName = "Product C2", MixProportion = 50%
9. In the Python app, create a demo work order in the following way:
	* WorkOrderID: String = New GUID
	* WorkOrderNumber: In32 = Start with 100000 and keep incrementing the number by 1
	* TimeZone: TimeZoneDataType (https://profiledesigner.cesmii.net/type/125298) = Use US Central Time
	* StartTimeLocal: DateTime = Use current time in Central Time
	* StartTimeUTC: UtcTime = Use current UTC time
	* EndTimeLocal: DateTime = StartTimeLocal + 8 hours
	* EndTimeUTC: UtcTime = StartTimeUTC + 8 hours
	* ProductID: String = Look up a random product from DemoProducts and get its ProductID and save the looked up product as tmpProduct
	* ProductNumber: Int64 = get ProductNumber value from tmpProduct
	* ProductName: String = get ProductName from tmpProduct
	* LotNumber: String = set to prefix "LOT-" followed by current date time formatted as "YYYYMMDD-HHmmss"
	* UnitOfMeasure: String = set to "CS"
	* Quantity: Double = set a random integer number between 12 and 120 that is divisible by 6 (tmpQuantity)
	* WeightUnitOfMeasure: String = "lb"
	* Weight: Double = Multiply Quantity by 2 (tmpWeight)
	* FeedIngredients: look up a list of ingredients in DemoProducts for the tmpProduct and add it here, while setting individual Quantity field on each ingredient to parent Quantity (tmpQuantity) multiplied by MixProportion and Weight on each ingredient to the parent Weight (tmpWeight) multiplied by MixProportion; set ingredient lots to racndom 6-character alphanumeric sequences in all caps
10. Publish the work order to the MQTT broker to the "mqtt-publish-topic" as a retained message.
11. Create a writeup of the architecture in claude.md
12. Update README.MD with a thorough description of this demo. State that the purpose of this is to demonstrate the use of CESMII SM Profiles.
